“Core fee” is an umbrella term that encompasses tuition, non-resident supplemental tuition, professional degree supplemental tuition, self-supporting graduate professional degree (night classes), and the SSF.

Core fees are paid by all relevant student groups as a requirement for attendance at the University. They also fund “core” university functions (such as lecturer salary, janitorial services, classroom space, wifi, etc.) which are necessary to the academic experience.

Note that these charts depict fees **per quarter** for the academic year 2025-26. Additional fees that are not included in these charts can be found in the [Additional Fees](additional-fees.md) section.
